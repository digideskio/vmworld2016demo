# VMworld 2016 Demo Repo

This repo holds four demos for VMworld 2016

1. **Swarm**: This demo uses Docker machine to build a six node cluster, and then show some of the new capabilities in Swarm mode. There is a demo script as well as a recording of the demo (recording forthcoming). 

2. **Catweb**: This demo is a build-ship-run workflow using Docker for Mack, Docker Trusted Registry, and Docker Universal Control Plane. UCP and DTR are hosted in Azure. There is a demo script, as well as a recording of the demo.

3. **Kiosk**: This demo is designed for attendees to launch their first docker container. By issuing a single command an Nginx-based website is launched, with  a button that allows the attendee to send a Tweet about launching their first container. There is a demo script (but no video)

## Upcoming Changes
1. Need to upload the videos or links to the video for Swarm

2. Need to add the Windows Server Containers video.
